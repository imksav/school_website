          kash University has established in Magh 2041 BS  at Basundhara  Dol, a point very close to the famous Ring Road of Kathmandu  Valley. The site was specially chosen, as this road is the life-cycle of the valley and is easily accessible from any corner of the city by transportation. Due to its convenient location, the school is managed very efficiently in all respect. Truly, the school is set like a jewel on the ring road and every effort is made by the management and its staff to make it a gem of the place.<br/>
